It is clear from the previous discussion that for all the cases xRy $\Rightarrow$ xzRyz. Thus, R is a right

invariant.

  5.\, Check whether a set of numbers divisible by n is closed under subtraction and division (except

\quad\, division by 0) operation.
\end{flushleft}

\textsf{\textbf{Solution:}} A set of numbers divisible by n can be represented as $S = \{0, n, 2n, 3n, 4n,……\}$.

\textsf{\textbf{Subtraction:}}

\begin{center}
  $ n - 0 = n $

  $n - 2n =  -n$

  $3n - n = 2n$

  …………..
\end{center}

In general, $(m - p)n-(m-q).n = n(q-p)$. This may or may not be divisible by n. So, a

set of numbers divisible by n is not closed under division.

\textsl{\textbf{Division:}}

\begin{center}
2n/n = 2

3n/2n = 3/2

…………......
\end{center}

In general, $(m - p)n/(m-q).n = (m-p)/(m-q)$. This may or may not be divisible by n. So,a set of

numbers divisible by n is not closed under division.
